# About
Timestretch (as the name implies) takes a .wav file and "stretches" it out, and saves it as a new .wav file. This script is currently being developed. Right now, basic linear interpolation is being used to compute new samples as a means to stretch out the original audio.

# Running the code
Ensure that the scipy and numpy packages are installed with Python 2.7 or above. Simply run 'timestretch.py' to see the code in action. As of now, in order to modify the path of the audio file or stretch factor, one must modify the code itself.

# Motivation
I was interested in implementing a few different interpolation techniques. In addition, I would like to incorporate an algorithm that uses extreme time-stretching to produce interesting and creative results. Stayed tuned!
